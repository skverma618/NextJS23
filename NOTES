SERVER SIDE COMPONENTS CANNOT:
- Listen to browser events
- Access the DOM
- Access the window object
- Access Browser API's like local storage
- Use Effect Hook
- Maintain state

FETCHING ON CLIENT SIDE:
- Fetching data on the client side is done using the Fetch API, React Query, UseEffect + useState
- Resource intensive, No SEO, arge Bundles as everything happens on the client side
- Extra rountrip to the server, first HTML is loaded, then JS is loaded, then data is fetched

DATA CACHING ON SERVER SIDE:
- Nextjs comes with a builtin Cache Provider which is based on file system.
- It is used to fetch data on the client side and keep it in sync with the server cache.
- Its stores the data in cache for each route by default, but we have full controll over it.
- We can also use Redis, Memcached, etc for caching.
- Caching functions like revalidate are provided only with fetch function, not with 3rd party libraries like axios.
